Ryan Hoeck -- Wrote most of the code, reformatted and applied code from program
	2, lexer to be used in this assignment. Figured out how to write and
	implement all the functions, and those outlined or not by the guidelines.

Alexander Dossantos -- wrote the lexer code in the previous project that was
	implemented into this project. Also wrote the put_symbol and get_symbol
	funtcions, aswell as all around improvements




This project was confusing, and with communication problems it was even harder.
Will we be able to get another day or so to complete this? Any time and more explanation
can only help.
